    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="step">Think about what kind of global goal do you want to reach with this action? Like, "I want to be a high payed programmer, thats why i need to do this html lesson".</li>
        <li class="step">Try to understand that this particular action is not leading to your global goal. It is just a small step and there is no guaranties that you reach your goal.</li>
        <li class="step">Concentrate on doing action itself. The goal is to do the task, thats all. Your ambition is irrelevant, you just need to complete the task and feel good about yourself.</li>
        <li class="step">If you feel less resistance, do the task. If not, try next technique.</li>

    </ol>
