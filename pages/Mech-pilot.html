        <li>Imagine your body and your mind is just a tools or weapons of your meha. You can take to account, what they "saying" to you, but you also can ignore it.</li>
        <li>Tell to yourself that you can do whatever you want in this state for 10 minutes without any damage to your meha. This is safe no matter condition of the meha.</li>
